Protocol
========

The protocol used between the Gateway and the Controller is a simple semicolon
separated list of values. The last part of each "command" is the payload.
All commands ends with a newline. The serial commands has the following format:

    ::
    
    <node-id>;<child-sensor-id>;<message-type>;<ack>;<sub-type>;<payload>\n

Message Structure Elements
**************************

================  =======================================================================================================================
Message Part      Description
================  =======================================================================================================================
node-id           The unique id of the node that sends or should receive the message (address)
child-sensor-id   Each node can have several sensors attached. This is the child-sensor-id that uniquely identifies one attached sensor
message-type      | Type of message sent - See table below ack
                  | The ack parameter has the following meaning:
                  | Outgoing: 0 = unacknowledged message, 1 = request ack from destination node
                  | Incoming: 0 = normal message, 1 = this is an ack message
sub-type          Depending on messageType this field has different meaning. See tables below
payload           The payload holds the message coming in from sensors or instruction going out to actuators.
================  =======================================================================================================================
    
.. warning::

    The maximum payload size is 25 bytes!

    The NRF24L01+ has a maximum of 32 bytes. The MySensors library (version 1.5) uses 7 bytes for the message header.

Message Types
*************

============= ===== ====================================================
Type	      Value	Comment
============= ===== ====================================================
presentation  0     Sent by a node when they present attached sensors. This is usually done in setup() at startup.
set	          1     This message is sent from or to a sensor when a sensor value should be updated.
req	          2     Requests a variable value (usually from an actuator destined for controller).
internal	  3     This is a special internal message. See table below for the details.
stream	      4     Used for OTA firmware updates.
============= ===== ====================================================

Message Sub-types
*****************


.. note::

    If you feel that these sub-types don't fit your needs, there are some
    custom varaibles that you can use. However, you think that people maybe
    have the same issue, you can modify the liberary and add your variable,
    then, pull your modifications to the development branch.

Presentation
------------

When a presentation message is sent from a sensor, sub-type can one the following:

The payload of presentation message will be set to the library version (node device) or an optional description for the sensors.

Internal
--------

The internal messages are used for different tasks in the communication between sensors, the gateway to controller and between sensors and the gateway.

When an internal messages is sent, the sub-type has to be one of the following:

=======================   ====== =========================================

I_BATTERY_LEVEL           0      Use this to report the battery level (in percent 0-100).
I_TIME                    1      Sensors can request the current time from the Controller using this message. The time will be reported as the seconds since 1970
I_VERSION                 2      Used to request gateway version from controller.
I_ID_REQUEST              3      Use this to request a unique node id from the controller.
I_ID_RESPONSE             4      Id response back to sensor. Payload contains sensor id.
I_INCLUSION_MODE          5      Start/stop inclusion mode of the Controller (1=start, 0=stop).
I_CONFIG                  6      Config request from node. Reply with (M)etric or (I)mperal back to sensor.
I_FIND_PARENT             7      When a sensor starts up, it broadcast a search request to all neighbor nodes. They reply with a I_FIND_PARENT_RESPONSE.
I_FIND_PARENT_RESPONSE    8      Reply message type to I_FIND_PARENT request.
I_LOG_MESSAGE             9      Sent by the gateway to the Controller to trace-log a message
I_CHILDREN                10     A message that can be used to transfer child sensors (from EEPROM routing table) of a repeating node.
I_SKETCH_NAME             11     Optional sketch name that can be used to identify sensor in the Controller GUI
I_SKETCH_VERSION          12     Optional sketch version that can be reported to keep track of the version of sensor in the Controller GUI.
I_REBOOT                  13     Used by OTA firmware updates. Request for node to reboot.
I_GATEWAY_READY           14     Send by gateway to controller when startup is complete.
I_REQUEST_SIGNING         15     Used between sensors when initialting signing.
I_GET_NONCE               16     Used between sensors when requesting nonce.

    There are some messages which are processed by the MySensors library.
    Which means that you don't have to implement an action for them.

    E.g.: I_REBOOT.
