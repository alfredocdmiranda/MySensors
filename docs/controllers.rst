Controllers
===========

Controllers are softwares which are responsible for answer the requests
from the nodes and send commands made by users to nodes.

Example of tasks made by controllers:

- Auto assign an ID to a node
- Keep tracking of node on the network

All the magic is made by the controllers, the nodes are just responsible for
collect and send the data. Then, the controller gather the all data and "think"
how it should respond.

You can control your nodes send commands over your gateway. However, if you
really want to automate your home, you must use a controller. If you don't
know how or you don't want to developer a new one, you can use one of them
listed below.
